## Implementation  



## Database script  
The database script contains tables, sample data and a user role  
[The script can be found here](https://github.com/RasmusLynge/DB_Assignment_1/blob/main/SCRIPT.sql)  

The user created with the script:  
- username: bruger  
- password: bruger  
  
You might have to change the schema (line 222) if you run the script elsewhere.  

## Java program  
Clone this project to run the java program.
You might have to change the credentials to run the script on your database. (line 22 and 53 in main java class)
